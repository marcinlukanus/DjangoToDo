# Django To Do Project
## About To Do Project
This is a simple web app that allows users to create profiles and to do lists. This is my first time using Django for a personal project, so I hope to gain some additional experience with it through this.

## Features
Users will be able to sign up and login, and create to do tasks which will be displayed as their home page once logged in. They will be able to manage their lists by adding new tasks, checking off tasks as completed, and viewing their tasks by tasks' dates to be completed.
